# 🙂 Welcome

Hello and welcome to this project. Here are some of the things I've used for this project:
- Fastlane: Faster and more accurate build creation
- Git-crypt: Encrypting sensitive information before pushing to Git
- Dart additional run args: To avoid exposing key data
- Mockito: Smoother test writing experience
- Go router: Nice routing solution
- Riverpod: Amazing powerful state manager
- Logger: To improve the debuggin and development process
- Retrofit: Handling data layer API calls
- Geolocator/Geocoder: Getting user location and finding the city based on coordinate

# 🏗️ Architecture
It's "Clean architecture" (Uncle bob). I tried to separate the code into 3 layers of:
- Data
- Domain
- Presentation
The "Presentation" is responsible for UI-related components such as State managers, Widgets, and UI models.

# 🔐 Encryption
I'm using Git-crypt to encrypt the sensitive information before pushing to git, and I'm using "Symmetric Mode", therefore you need a Keyfile. Please reach out to iamartinmrt@gmail.com to receive it. https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/

# 🚀 Fastlane
The entry point of Fastlane in order to create a build is "start" method which is the only public lane, you need to go to root directory and run this command on your terminal:
`fastlane start`, then you will be guided by the of my instruction on your terminal 🤓
